# Advanced-House-Price-Prediction
The main aim of this project is to predict the house price based on various features.
The dataset contains 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. 
Dataset downloaded from the below link https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data

I have performed detailed exploratory data analysis of dataset. I have used linear regression machine learnimg model along with L1 and L2 regularization (Ridge and Lasso regression) and other different Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting to predict the house price and compared residual and scores of the models.

The goal is to predict the accurate SalePrice with given features. The models are evaluated using the Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE).
